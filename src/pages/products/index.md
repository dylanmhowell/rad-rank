        The SEO Audit.

        Our team tears apart your site, looking for both technical and content
        related issues. This is the base of any SEO project. If you don't have a
        quality audit, you're essentially flying blind. After the audit, we
        don't just turn you loose. We have a re-cap call to go over the report
        and make plans to move forward.
