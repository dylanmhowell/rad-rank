  learning some more technical techniques, but rather lets you concentrate on
  mastering the overal strategies of SEO.

        The SEO Audit.

        Our team tears apart your site, looking for both technical and content
        related issues. This is the base of any SEO project. If you don't have a
        quality audit, you're essentially flying blind. After the audit, we
        don't just turn you loose. We have a re-cap call to go over the report
        and make plans to move forward.
